#  ES6 Data Manipulation

This README provides an overview of various data structures introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that can help you efficiently manipulate data in JavaScript applications.


###Array

    An Array is a JavaScript data structure that stores a collection of values.
    It is ordered and indexed, allowing you to access elements using numerical indices.
    Arrays can hold values of different data types.
    Offers a wide range of methods for manipulation, such as adding, removing, or modifying elements.

### Typed Array

    A Typed Array is designed for working with binary data and is commonly used in web APIs like WebGL and the File API.
    Unlike regular arrays, typed arrays have a fixed length and contain elements of a specific data type.
    They are more memory-efficient and faster for certain operations due to their low-level representation.

### Set Data Structure

    A Set is a JavaScript data structure that holds a collection of unique values.
    Sets are ideal for maintaining distinct elements and efficiently checking for the presence of specific values.
    Provides methods for adding, deleting, and checking elements for existence.

### Map Data Structure

    A Map is a data structure used to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
    Maps are useful for associating values with specific keys, allowing efficient data retrieval based on identifiers.
    Offers methods for adding, deleting, and iterating over key-value pairs.

### WeakMap

    A WeakMap is a special map that allows keys to be held weakly, enabling associated values to be garbage collected.
    Used when you need to associate data with objects without preventing those objects from being cleaned up when they are no longer needed.
    Less common than regular Maps but valuable for memory management scenarios.


## Learning Objectives

### How to use map, filter, and reduce on arrays:

    Understand the purpose and benefits of array manipulation methods like map, filter, and reduce.
    Learn how to use the map function to transform each element of an array into a new array.
    Explore how the filter function can be used to extract elements from an array based on specified criteria.
    Grasp the concept of reducing an array to a single value using the reduce function and its various applications.

### Typed arrays:

    Familiarize yourself with typed arrays and their use cases in JavaScript.
    Understand the differences between typed arrays and regular arrays, including fixed length and data type constraints.
    Learn how to create and manipulate typed arrays for efficient data handling, especially in scenarios involving binary data.

### The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures:

    Gain an understanding of the Set data structure and its purpose in maintaining unique values within a collection.
    Explore the Map data structure and learn how to associate key-value pairs, ideal for data organization.
    Discover the WeakMap data structure and its role in memory management and associating data with objects while allowing for garbage collection.

These learning objectives will guide your exploration of these topics and help you develop a solid understanding of array manipulation, typed arrays, and the Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures in JavaScript.
