# 0x00. ES6 Basics

This project explores the fundamentals of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 6 or JavaScript ES6. ES6 is a significant update to the JavaScript language, introducing new features, syntax enhancements, and improvements to make JavaScript code more expressive and efficient.

## Introduction to ES6

ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) is a major update to the JavaScript language, released in 2015. It introduced several new features and syntax improvements that enhance the clarity and expressiveness of JavaScript code.

## Constants and Variables

In ES6, you can declare variables using const and let. Understanding the difference between constants and variables is crucial for writing reliable and maintainable code.

## Block-Scoped Variables

ES6 introduced block-scoped variables using let and const. This means that variables declared with these keywords are only accessible within the block they are defined in, leading to better variable scoping.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a concise way to define functions in ES6. They automatically capture the this value from the surrounding code, making them useful for certain programming patterns.

## Rest and Spread Parameters

ES6 allows you to use rest and spread operators in function parameters. The rest operator (...) collects multiple arguments into an array, while the spread operator (...) spreads an array into individual arguments.

## String Templating

String templating in ES6 simplifies string concatenation and interpolation. You can embed variables and expressions directly within strings using template literals.

## Object Creation and Properties

ES6 provides new syntax for creating objects and defining object properties. Understanding these features can help you create cleaner and more organized code.

## Iterators and for-of Loops

ES6 introduced iterators and the for-of loop, which provide a more convenient way to iterate over collections like arrays, sets, and maps.
